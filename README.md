Hello World Github Guide

My name is Brandon Barney and I am a computer programmer.  I also am a public radio programmer.  And I have some other skills.  I love Los Angeles area beaches and universities and people.  I try to solve problems and spread wisdom.  I don't have much else to say but I hope that I can fill this readme with actions.
